F0x86 - Proof of Concept x86 Assembler and Disassembler
=============================================

# What is this

F0x86 is a x86 assembler and disassembler targeting Java 7.
It is an old project of mine and was meant as a larger sized example project to test my F0xCv2 toolchain on and to be dependent on FASM anymore.
I kinda forgot about this project but as it is actually working and reasonable structured / documented I thought there is value in putting it up on its own.
For a list of implemented instructions, see [this file](src/pusty/f0x86/base). Not really tested much but possibly good demo to test bytecode processing tools on or to see how some basic x86 encodings work.
